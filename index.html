        Blender is a free, open source software that can help you with every step of the 3D and 2D pipeline. With many resources available to
        learn, Blender makes it possible for <i>anyone</i> to begin their animation journey. It offers sculpting, VFX, rigging, animation, simulation,
        rendering, and much more. When you know how to use it, Blender is all you need to start creating your own projects.
